Slides for a talk at Kent State in March, 2018 (see slides.rmd)...

I am certainly *not* an expert in deep learning, but I am enthusiastic about

If you find errors or inaccuracies, please let me know!


Portions of these slides are from Taylor Arnold and J. J. Allaire. I
am indebted to both of them for introducing me to this topic.
